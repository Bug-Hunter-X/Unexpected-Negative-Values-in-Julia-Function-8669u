# Julia Function Bug
This repository demonstrates a common error in Julia functions related to operator precedence and negative numbers. The function `myfunction` is designed to return the square of a number, but it produces unexpected negative outputs for negative inputs due to the order of operations. 

The bug and its solution are presented in the `bug.jl` and `bugSolution.jl` files respectively.
